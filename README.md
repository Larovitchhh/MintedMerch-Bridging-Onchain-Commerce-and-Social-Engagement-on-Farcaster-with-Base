MintedMerch: Bridging Onchain Commerce and Social Engagement on Farcaster with Base
What is MintedMerch?
MintedMerch is a Farcaster Miniapp that enables creators and communities to launch onchain merchandise drops directly within the Farcaster ecosystem. It’s part of a growing trend of social-commerce Mini Apps that combine the viral nature of decentralized social media with the utility of blockchain-based transactions.
MintedMerch allows users to mint limited-edition digital or physical items—like apparel, collectibles, or NFTs—without leaving their Farcaster feed. This seamless experience is powered by Farcaster’s Mini App framework and the Base network’s scalable infrastructure.
