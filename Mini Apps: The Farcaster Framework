Mini Apps: The Farcaster Framework
Mini Apps are embedded web applications built with standard technologies (HTML, CSS, JS) and enhanced by Farcasterâ€™s SDK. They offer:

In-feed Interactivity: Users engage with apps directly from posts or channels.
Wallet Integration: Ethereum wallets are natively supported for minting, purchasing, or claiming.
Social Graph Access: Apps can personalize experiences using cast data, reactions, and user profiles.
Notifications & Retention: Developers can re-engage users with mobile alerts and persistent app states. [miniapps.f...caster.xyz]

MintedMerch uses these capabilities to deliver a frictionless minting experience that feels native to Farcaster.
